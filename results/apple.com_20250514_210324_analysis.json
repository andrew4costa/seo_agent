Proactive monitoring and optimization for Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), and First Input Delay (FID) are necessary to prevent future regressions and ensure a consistently seamless user experience, especially on older devices or slower networks.  Given Apple's high-value products, even minor performance dips could significantly impact conversion rates."

Implementing structured data for product details (price, availability, reviews, images) will increase click-through rates and improve overall search performance.
